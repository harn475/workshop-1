## Coding Fundamentals 
I continued being excited about the colour of the background and used this to inspire me when starting workshop one. <br />

I chose to use a circle as my new shape.
I experimented with functions, creating a flower function as my main component. 
I had some trouble when it came to the random numbers, when creating more flowers I found that they fell apart and the circles were all over the screen, or clumped together. <br />
I fixed this myself by going back to the workshop, and slowing trouble shooting by changing one number at a time. I also made the 'petals' all different colours (before changing them to white to resemble a daisy) as it was easier to view the petals - at this point I hadn't thought to change the number of petals down to the one. <br />
I also had an issue with the flowers all forming in the upper left corner, although still randomly appearing, they never touched the bottom right corner. to fix this I changed the limit on the random from width to 500. I would be interested in looking further into this to work out why they werent touching, and not having to expand the parameters.
