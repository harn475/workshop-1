## Coding Fundamentals 
I continued being excited about the colour of the background and used this to inspire me when starting workshop one. <br />

I chose to use a circle as my new shape.
I experimented with functions, creating a flower function as my main component. 
I had some trouble when it came to the random numbers, when creating more flowers I found that they fell apart and the circles were all over the screen, or clumped together. <br />
I fixed this myself by going back to the workshop, and slowing trouble shooting by changing one number at a time. I also made the 'petals' all different colours (before changing them to white to resemble a daisy) as it was easier to view the petals - at this point I hadn't thought to change the number of petals down to the one. <br />
I also had an issue with the flowers all forming in the upper left corner, although still randomly appearing, they never touched the bottom right corner. to fix this I changed the limit on the random from width to 500. I would be interested in looking further into this to work out why they werent touching, and not having to expand the parameters.

**Declaration:**

I declare that I received help with my coding from my flatmate, who is experienced with programming. Additionally, I conducted several quick Google searches to resolve issues encountered during the development process. These searches helped in understanding how to implement specific features and troubleshoot problems, especially related to p5.js, as well as getting advice from relevant forums and communities.
